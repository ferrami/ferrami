ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Fernando, you can find me as @ferrami on GitHub.

ðŸš€ I'm a web developer who loves working on the whole package - from building the backend to designing the front-end, making websites look great, and user-friendly.

ðŸ’¡ I'm always learning by working on web projects. I'm getting really good at using MERN Stack, Python Flask, React, JavaScript, and Node.js. I'm all about using these skills to make awesome web apps and services.

ðŸ“¬ You can connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandoramirezl/

ðŸŒŸ I'm thrilled to be part of the digital revolution in art, especially in web development, design, and audiovisual production. Let's build the future together!
